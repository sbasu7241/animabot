# ANIMABOT
Simple chatbot framework named Anima created using Rivescript and Python for personal learning purposes.

I initially thought of making this into a full fledged chatbot (and I do have another repo where I have done some upgrades), but now have other projects that are higher priority.

# How to Use
1. Clone the app into your device.
2. Run via "python app.py".

# Other info:
- You can use this as a simple framework to start working on your own Rivescript chatbot. Please link to this repo if you do so.
- I suggest you read the [Rivescript tutorial](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial) to take full advantage of this framework.
- You can add your name into the `creatorname` array in `brain/begin.rive`.
